To do list:


Need to test 1 button without time.sleep for real time updates

  --tested this and moved the code around but everytime time.sleep() i.e the time delay was removed, the gui would crash or would not get a response from the buttons

need to test 2 button setup

need to find a way to end all threads when user exits

     -- because issue of worker thread running after program has been closed. 
     -- Temporary workaround for this has been using a time delay so that the thread only continues until the timer is finished.
     
     -- tried using a variable to determine whether the program had quit or not but this did not work.
